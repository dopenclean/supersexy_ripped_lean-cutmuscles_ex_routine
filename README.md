# Weekly Gym Routine for Ripped, Compact Physique

This is a 4-day bro split routine designed for a 29-year-old male (5'11", starting at 200lbs, aiming for 165-175lbs at 8-12% body fat). Focus: Slim, highly defined muscles with visible cuts (e.g., jawline, biceps through shirts, forearm strings, calves) without bulk. Use adjustable dumbbells (up to 20kg each or 40kg barbell mode) and 9-in-1 adjustable bench.

- **General Guidelines**:
  - Sessions: 45-60 minutes.
  - Warm-up: 5min light cardio (e.g., jumping jacks) + dynamic stretches.
  - Cool-down: Static stretches for targeted muscles.
  - Sets/Reps: 3 sets per exercise, 8-12 reps (strength focus) or 10-15 reps (definition focus). Rest 60-90sec between sets.
  - Progression: Increase reps/weight weekly; use slow tempos or pauses if maxed at 20kg.
  - Cardio: Add 20min brisk walk post-workout on training days (3x/week) for fat burn.
  - Track: Use an app/notebook for progress. Reassess every 4 weeks.
  - Recovery: If sore, add extra rest. Sleep 7-9hrs/night.
