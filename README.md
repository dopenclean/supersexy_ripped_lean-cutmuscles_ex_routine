## MONDAY: Upper A - The Frame Builder

**Goal:** Create shoulder width and V-taper (the foundation of the "triangle" physique)

### 1. Barbell Overhead Press (Seated)
**Sets:** 4 × 8-10 reps | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 (3 sec down, explode up) | **Rest:** 90 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Anterior Deltoid (Front Shoulder) - 60%
- Lateral Deltoid (Side Shoulder) - 30%
- Triceps (Back of Arm) - 10%

**How It Works:** The overhead press is the king of shoulder mass builders. Pressing overhead forces maximum recruitment of all three deltoid heads while creating stability through your core. The seated position removes leg drive, isolating the shoulders. This builds vertical height to your frame, making you look bigger in clothes.

**Execution Cue:** Press bar in a straight line above your head. Lock out fully. Control the descent for 3 full seconds.

---

### 2. Dumbbell Lateral Raises
**Sets:** 5 × 15-20 reps | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 60 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Lateral Deltoid (Side Shoulder) - 90%
- Anterior Deltoid (Front Shoulder) - 10%

**How It Works:** This is THE single most important exercise for the "Lookism" physique. The lateral deltoid creates shoulder width when viewed from the front. Wide shoulders make your waist appear smaller, creating the coveted shoulder-to-waist ratio. Since this muscle has mostly slow-twitch fibers, higher reps (15-20) with perfect control produce superior results.

**Execution Cue:** Lean forward 10 degrees. Lead with your pinky finger. Imagine "pouring a pitcher of water" at the top. No swinging.

---

### 3. Barbell Bent-Over Row (Overhand Grip)
**Sets:** 4 × 10-12 reps | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 90 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Latissimus Dorsi (Lats - Side Back) - 60%
- Rhomboids (Mid Back) - 20%
- Rear Deltoid (Rear Shoulder) - 15%
- Biceps - 5%

**How It Works:** The lats are responsible for back width. When developed, they create the "V-taper" that makes your waist look narrow. Rowing with an overhand grip (palms down) emphasizes lat width over thickness. Pulling to your belly button rather than chest maximizes lat engagement.

**Execution Cue:** Hinge at hips, back flat. Pull bar to belly button, elbows at 45-degree angle. Squeeze shoulder blades together at top.

---

### 4. Incline Dumbbell Press (30° Angle)
**Sets:** 4 × 10-12 reps | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 90 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Upper Pectoralis (Upper Chest) - 70%
- Anterior Deltoid (Front Shoulder) - 20%
- Triceps - 10%

**How It Works:** The upper chest is what you see when wearing a V-neck or unbuttoned shirt. Most people overdevelop lower chest and neglect this area. A 30-degree incline specifically targets the clavicular head of the pectoralis, creating the "shelf" appearance that looks impressive in normal clothing.

**Execution Cue:** Set bench to 30 degrees (not 45). Lower dumbbells to upper chest, elbows at 45 degrees. Press up and slightly together.

---

### 5. Dumbbell Hammer Curls (Alternating)
**Sets:** 3 × 12 reps per arm | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 60 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Brachialis (Outer Arm) - 60%
- Biceps Brachii - 25%
- Brachioradialis (Forearm) - 15%

**How It Works:** Unlike regular curls that target bicep peak, hammer curls build the brachialis muscle that sits underneath the bicep. When developed, it pushes the bicep up and out, making arms look thicker from the front view. The neutral grip also heavily engages forearms, contributing to the "vascular" look in T-shirts.

**Execution Cue:** Keep palms facing each other (neutral grip). Keep elbows locked to sides. No torso swing.

---

### 6. Overhead Dumbbell Tricep Extension
**Sets:** 3 × 12-15 reps | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 60 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Triceps Long Head (Back of Arm) - 80%
- Triceps Lateral Head - 20%

**How It Works:** The triceps make up 2/3 of arm mass. The long head is responsible for the "horseshoe" shape and arm size when your arm is relaxed (which is 99% of the time). Overhead extensions stretch the long head maximally, triggering growth. This creates arm size that's visible even when not flexing.

**Execution Cue:** Hold one dumbbell overhead with both hands. Lower behind head until you feel a deep stretch. Keep elbows pointed forward (don't let them flare out).

---

**MONDAY SUMMARY:**
- **Total Exercises:** 6
- **Total Sets:** 23
- **Workout Time:** ~50 minutes
- **Focus:** Shoulder width (lateral delts 5 sets) + V-taper (lats 4 sets) + upper chest visibility

## TUESDAY: Lower A - Quads & Core Foundation

**Goal:** Athletic leg development and visible abdominal definition

### 1. Goblet Squat (Heels Elevated 2 inches)
**Sets:** 4 × 12-15 reps | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 90 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Quadriceps (Front Thigh) - 70%
- Glutes - 20%
- Core Stabilizers - 10%

**How It Works:** Elevating heels shifts weight forward onto the quads, minimizing hip/glute involvement. This creates the "teardrop" quad muscle (vastus medialis) that gives an athletic, defined look without bulky hips. Goblet position keeps torso upright, preventing lower back stress common in barbell squats. Perfect for the "slim but defined" leg aesthetic.

**Execution Cue:** Place small plates (2-3 inches) under heels. Hold dumbbell at chest. Squat deep (hip crease below knee). Keep chest vertical.

---

### 2. Bulgarian Split Squat
**Sets:** 4 × 10-12 reps per leg | **Tempo:** 3-0-1 | **Rest:** 60 sec between legs

**Primary Muscles:**
- Quadriceps - 50%
- Glutes - 40%
- Hamstrings - 10%

**How It Works:** The single most effective exercise for leg aesthetics. The unilateral (one-leg) nature fixes muscle imbalances while burning massive calories. The stretch position at the bottom creates muscle damage that triggers growth. Also heavily engages glutes for posture and athletic appearance without making legs overly bulky.

**Execution Cue:** Rear foot elevated on bench/chair. Front foot far enough forward that knee stays behind toes. Lower until rear knee nearly touches floor.

---

### 3. Romanian Deadlift (Barbell)
**Sets:** 4 × 10-12 reps | **Tempo:** 4-0-1 (4 sec down for max hamstring stretch) | **Rest:** 90 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Hamstrings (Back of Thigh) - 60%
- Glutes - 25%
- Erector Spinae (Lower Back) - 15%

**How It Works:** RDLs build the posterior chain (back side of body) that's invisible in the mirror but critical for posture and athleticism. Strong hamstrings prevent knee injuries and create the "separation" between hamstring and glute. The spinal erectors force you to stand taller and more confidently. This is the anti-"programmer slouch" exercise.

**Execution Cue:** Slight knee bend (not a squat). Push hips back. Feel stretch in hamstrings. Keep bar close to shins. Back stays neutral (not rounded).

---

### 4. Weighted Crunch (Plate on Chest)
**Sets:** 4 × 20-25 reps | **Tempo:** 2-0-1 | **Rest:** 45 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Rectus Abdominis (Six-Pack Muscle) - 90%
- Obliques - 10%

**How It Works:** Abs are built in the gym and revealed in the kitchen. Weighted crunches build the "blocks" of the rectus abdominis, making them visible even at 12-13% body fat instead of requiring sub-10%. The key is progressive overload—adding weight over time. This creates the thick, defined abs that pop in good lighting.

**Execution Cue:** Hold 5-10kg plate on chest. Crunch (curl) your ribcage toward pelvis. Don't just lift shoulders. Full contraction at top.

---

### 5. Plank (Weighted if Possible)
**Sets:** 3 × 60-90 sec | **Rest:** 60 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Transverse Abdominis (Deep Core/Corset Muscle) - 70%
- Rectus Abdominis - 20%
- Erector Spinae - 10%

**How It Works:** The transverse abdominis (TVA) acts like a natural weightlifting belt, pulling your waist inward. This isn't about visible abs—it's about physically reducing waist circumference. When developed, the TVA creates the tight, narrow waist that makes your shoulders look wider. This is the SECRET to the V-taper illusion.

**Execution Cue:** Forearms on ground, body in straight line. Brace core like someone's about to punch your stomach. Don't let hips sag or pike up.

---

### 6. Lying Leg Raise
**Sets:** 4 × 15-20 reps | **Tempo:** 2-0-2 | **Rest:** 45 sec

**Primary Muscles:**
- Lower Rectus Abdominis (Lower Abs) - 70%
- Hip Flexors - 30%

**How It Works:** Targets the lower portion of abs and creates the "V-line" (Adonis b
