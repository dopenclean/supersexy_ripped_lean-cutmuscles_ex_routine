## PROGRESSION SYSTEM

### **Weeks 1-4: Foundation (Learn the movements)**
- Focus: Perfect form
- Tempo: 3-0-1 (3 seconds down, no pause, 1 second up)
- Rest: 90 seconds on big lifts, 60 seconds on accessories
- Goal: Establish baseline. Track what weight you can handle.

### **Weeks 5-8: Muscle Building**
- Tempo: 4-0-1 (4 second negatives = more muscle damage)
- When you hit top of rep range (e.g., 12 reps), add 1-2kg next session
- Goal: Build muscle mass while maintaining form

### **Weeks 9-12: Refinement**
- Tempo: 3-1-1 (add 1 second pause at hardest position)
- This eliminates momentum = pure strength
- You should be 2-4kg stronger than Week 1 on major lifts

### **Weeks 13-16: Density (More work, less rest)**
- Tempo: 3-1-1 maintained  
- Rest: Reduce to 60 seconds on everything
- More work in less time = better conditioning + fat loss
- If strength drops >15%, add rest back

### **Every 5th Week: DELOAD (Recovery week)**
- Cut total sets by 50%
- Keep same weights
- Use easy tempo (2-0-1)
- Focus on sleep, mobility, recovery
- This prevents burnout and injury

## EXERCISE SUBSTITUTIONS (If needed)

**If an exercise is too hard or equipment doesn't work:**

| Original Exercise | Substitute |
|------------------|------------|
| Dumbbell Shoulder Press | Pike Push-Ups (feet elevated) |
| Incline Dumbbell Press | Push-Ups with feet elevated |
| Bulgarian Split Squat | Reverse Lunges |
| Hip Thrust | Glute Bridge (same but shoulders on floor) |

---

## CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### **1. Progressive Overload**
- Every week, aim to do slightly more than last week
- Either: more reps, more weight, or less rest
- Write everything down in a notebook or phone app

### **2. Nutrition (Separate from training)**
- Get to 12-15% body fat (this is NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Training builds muscle, diet reveals it
- Eat 1g protein per pound of body weight
- Be in slight calorie deficit if fat, maintenance if lean

### **3. Consistency**
- 4 workouts per week, no exceptions
- Miss a workout? Do it the next day, don't skip
- Results come from months of consistency, not perfect workouts

### **4. Recovery**
- 7-8 hours sleep minimum
- 10,000 steps daily (walk more, builds cardio without killing gains)
- Stretch 10 minutes after each workout

### **5. Patience**
- Month 1: Learn movements, build base
- Month 2-3: Strength gains, some muscle visible
- Month 4-6: Noticeable physique changes
- Month 6-8: Transformation complete (at 12-15% body fat)

---

## TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

**Take photos every Sunday morning:**
- Front relaxed
- Side relaxed
- Back relaxed
- Front flexed

**Measure every 2 weeks:**
- Shoulders (widest point)
- Chest (nipple line)
- Waist (belly button)
- Arms (flexed, around peak)
- Thighs (widest point)

**Goal ratios:**
- Shoulder-to-waist: 1.6:1 (e.g., 48" shoulders / 30" waist)
- This is THE golden ratio for male attractiveness

**Weight:**
- Track daily, use weekly average
- At 5'11", target 165-175 lbs at 12-15% body fat
- Don't obsess over scale, focus on mirror and measurements
